In this project I developed a web page (landing page) accordingly to found in the internet .psd template. At first I performed a html structure trying to do it accordingly to semantic development. Then I applyed styles with css. I tryed to do everything accordingly to psd template. And finally I planed to make my web page adaptive, but descovered that to do that I need to reworked all the project. That's why I left one resolution screen size the same that was in psd template.
